3 Observations from the data
    
    1) Per student budget and overall pass rate are not a direct relationship. In fact, there is very little correlation between the two metrics, and some of the best performing schools have low per student budgets in comparison to their peers.
    
    2) The top 5 performing schools in terms of overall pass rate are all charter schools, and the worst 5 performing schools are all district schools. Even further, every single charter school was better performing than every single district school.
    
    3) Math scores annd Reading scores by grade are relatively consistent. I.e. there is not a marked increase or decrease in scores as the students progress through high school. This could indicate that the schools do a good job of increasing the difficulty of the course material in direct proportion to the knowledge gained by the student as they progress in their studies.
